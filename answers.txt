What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Rebase flattens all the previous commits into one long tree and removes some unused changes.
Merge creates a commit and combines changes in the current branch and target branch, preserving the other commits.

What is a remote repository?

Remote repositories are versions of your project that is hosted somewhere else such as another server. It allows
you to keep track of your changes and update history, as well as going back to a previous version of the project.
